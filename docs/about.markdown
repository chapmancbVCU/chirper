**What is Chappy.php?**

Chappy.php is a modern, full-stack PHP Model View Controller (MVC) framework designed for developers who want Laravel-style productivity with transparent architecture and hands-on control.

It provides:
- MVC routing with zero static route files
- Database migrations, seeders, and schema builders
- Authentication and ACL support
- Queue + job dispatching
- Events and listeners
- Notifications and mail services
- Native React + Vite integration
- PHPUnit and Vitest testing
- Symfony Console–based CLI tooling

All bundled into a lightweight, readable codebase that prioritizes clarity over magic.

Chappy.php is intentionally built to be understandable.

You can trace a request from browser → controller → model → response without guessing what the framework is doing behind the scenes.

**Why Chappy.php exists**

Chappy.php began as a professional systems-engineering exercise and evolved into a full framework.

The goal was simple:

> Initially, the purpose was built to better understand how MVC architecture operates and to establish a solid capstone project for my resume.  It eventually evolved into a  Laravel-inspired framework.

Instead of hiding complexity, Chappy.php exposes it in structured, approachable ways:
- Explicit routing behavior
- Clear service boundaries
- Human-readable migrations
- Framework-native React integration
- Observable queues and events
- Testable controllers and APIs
- Every feature exists because it was implemented, debugged, documented, and used in real projects.

This framework is not a clone.

It is a ground-up implementation driven by learning, engineering discipline, and practical application.

**Design philosophy**

Chappy.php follows a few core principles:

1. Transparency over magic

You should always know where something lives and how it works.

No hidden containers.
No invisible routing layers.
No implicit side effects.
No template engines.  Just create your PHP file and implement your view.

If something happens, you can find it.

2. Full-stack by default

Modern applications require more than PHP:
- React frontends
- API endpoints
- async jobs
- background workers
- asset bundling
- automated tests

Chappy.php ships with first-class support for all of it.

3. Systems thinking

The framework treats applications as systems:
- Queues for background processing
- Events for decoupling
- Services for business logic
- CLI tooling for automation
- Structured configuration
- Predictable environments

It is designed the same way production systems are designed.

**Who Chappy.php is for**

Chappy.php is ideal for:
- PHP developers who want deeper framework understanding
- Full-stack engineers working with React + APIs
- Systems engineers moving into application development
- Developers who value readable architecture
- Builders creating portfolio or production projects
- Engineers who want Laravel-style features without black boxes

It is especially useful for learning how modern frameworks actually work internally.

**Open source and ongoing development**

Chappy.php is actively developed and documented as both an open-source framework and a professional portfolio project.

Features are added deliberately, with full documentation and examples.

If you’re interested in contributing, exploring, or learning from the codebase, you’re welcome.
