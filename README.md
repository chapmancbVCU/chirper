# Chappy.php Starter Application

[Visit our Wiki](https://chapmancbvcu.github.io/chappy-php-starter/)

**Chappy.php** is a lightweight, extensible MVC PHP framework designed for developers who want clarity, power, and flexibility in their projects.

Originally a fork of the Ruah PHP MVC framework inspired by Freeskills’ YouTube series, we've expanded it with modern tools, cleaner structure, and new features.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. **Install system dependencies**:
  - PHP 8.4+
  - Composer
  - npm
2. **Create a new project**:
  ```bash
  composer create-project chappy-php/chappy-php my-app
  cd my-app
  ```
3. **Run the development server:**
  ```bash

  ```
4. **Start Vite dev server:**
